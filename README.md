This repository provides links to various custom-improved variants of the ResNet18 architecture. These models incorporate enhancements aimed at boosting performance and efficiency for different tasks.  

The modifications build upon techniques from the paper ["Bag of Tricks for Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01187), along with additional optimizations and personal refinements.  

Each variant has specific modifications tailored to its use case. Details about these improvements can be found in their respective repositories.  

The "D" in the variant names originates from ResNet-D of the referenced paper, reflecting the inspirations and architectural changes applied in these models.
